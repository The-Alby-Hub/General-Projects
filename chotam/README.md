# Chotam (חוֹתָם): local, post-quantum file encryption for macOS

*Chotam* is Hebrew for "seal", as in a signet seal pressed into wax: it keeps a document closed and proves who sealed it.

**Local files. Local encryption. Post-quantum safe. Minimal privileges. No unnecessary system extensions.**

A native macOS 26 (Swift 6 / SwiftUI) app that encrypts individual files:

- **Password mode:** Argon2id → HKDF → streaming AES-256-GCM.
- **Recipient mode:** a per-file Data Key, wrapped with HPKE X-Wing (ML-KEM-768 + X25519)
  and signed with ML-DSA-65.

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) | Byte-level file format v1 |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Threat model, non-goals, known limits, deviations from the spec |

## Status

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | FORMAT.md, SECURITY.md, streaming AES-GCM core with key commitment | done: 71 tests pass on macOS (Xcode) |
| 2 | Password mode (Argon2id via libsodium) | — |
| 3 | Atomic file processor | — |
| 4 | Identities, Keychain / Secure Enclave, fingerprints | — |
| 5 | Recipient mode: HPKE wrapping, ML-DSA signatures | — |
| 6 | SwiftUI app | — |
| 7 | Full test pass and security self-review | — |

## Building and testing

**macOS 26 with Xcode 26** (authoritative):

```sh
cd chotam/EncryptionCore
swift test
```

This uses the system CryptoKit. No packages are fetched.

**Linux** (development convenience only). Needs a Swift 6.2 toolchain. The manifest then adds
[apple/swift-crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto) 5.0.0 and swift-asn1 1.7.3,
both pinned exactly. They provide the same `AES.GCM` / `HKDF` / `SHA256` / `SymmetricKey`
API. They are declared inside `#if os(Linux)`, so a macOS build never resolves them.

```sh
cd chotam/EncryptionCore
swift build && swift test
```
